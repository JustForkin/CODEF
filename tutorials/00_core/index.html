FILE : 00_core

In this tutorial you can see how to create a simple canvas using the function :
	main=new canvas(640,480,"main");

As you can see you just have to specify the WIDTH and HEIGHT of the desired
canvas, and as a third param, you can specify the DIV id you want to be create.
If you don't specify a DIVid target the canvas will be created offscreen (meaning
it wont be shown, very usefull for some effects)

The canvas function return an object with some nice functions :
	.clear() = a fonction to clear the canvas
	.fill(color) = a fonction to fill entirely the canvas with the color.
